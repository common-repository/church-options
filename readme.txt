An all-in-one solution for churches to add the custom post types and custom fields they need for an effective website. Compatible theme required.

== Description ==

Most churches require the same few custom post types for their Web sites. The Church Options plugin creates those post types with the check of a box. These post types include Events, Announcements, Sermons, Ministries, People (staff), and Verses. Most of them also have custom fields for things like dates and contacts.

For these post types and fields to be used **requires** a theme custom made to work with them. Themes are available at [Quixotic Studios](http://quixotic-studios.com/themes) for purchase which have been custom made to work with the Church Options plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Log into your Wordpress admin area
2. Go to **Plugins->Add New**
3. Search for *Church Options*
4. Click **Install Now** for the plugin
5. Click **Activate Plugin** once installation is complete
6. A sidebar item *Church Options* will appear at the bottom of the left sidebar
7. Click on **Church Options->Settings** to choose the post types you wish to use


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin with any theme? =

No. The custom post types and custom fields require a theme that has been custom coded to use them or they can not be displayed on the site.

= Where can I get a theme that works with this plugin? =

Themes are available at [Quixotic Studios](http://quixotic-studios.com/themes).

= I don't like the available themes, can I get something custom? =

Yes. In fact, at Quixotic Studios we design and develope custom themes for churches that work with our Church Options plugin for free, as long as we are allowed to then sell that theme on [our themes page](http://quixotic-studios.com/themes). If you would prefer to keep your theme unique (not letting us sell it), then contact us for a quote.

= Do I have to use all the post types? =

No. You can use only the ones you need. They can be chosen in the *Church Options* plugin settings page by clicking the appropriate checkbox and then *Save Changes*.
